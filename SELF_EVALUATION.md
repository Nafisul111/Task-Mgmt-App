# Self-Evaluation: Task Management App

## Half-Page Summary

I worked on a Kanban-style task management app using a component-based approach in React. The project features drag-and-drop functionality implemented with native HTML5 APIs, without relying on any external libraries. The layout is fully responsive across all devices, providing a consistent user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. The overall structure is clean and maintainable, with clearly separated concerns between UI components and logic.

## Self-Criticism

- The drag-and-drop logic can be further modularized for better reusability.
- Some Redux logic could be more optimized or abstracted.
- The UI/UX could benefit from additional color effects.

## Improvements

If given more time:

- I would enhance the drag-and-drop with smoother transitions and visual feedback.
- Add unit and integration tests for Redux slices and component behaviors.
- Integrate https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ backend API.
- Add filters and sorting capabilities for tasks.
