# Task Management App

A simple task management app with drag-and-drop functionality for managing tasks across Todo, In Progress, and Done columns.

##  Technologies Used
- React.js
- Redux Toolkit
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)

##  How to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone the repo:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Task-Mgmt-App.git

2. Install dependencies:
   cd Task-Mgmt-App
   npm install

# Architecture & Approach

1. Component-based Architecture: Each UI section is modular (e.g., TaskCard, Column, TaskFormModal).

2. State Management: Redux Toolkit is used for scalable and predictable state management.

3. No External Libraries for Drag-Drop: Custom drag-and-drop was implemented using native HTML5 APIs.

4. Clean Code & Reusable Logic: Clear separation of concerns between UI and logic.
